# Emote Custom Thumbnail
Tired of Roblox's automatic emote thumbnails? This plugin gives you full control over every parameter Roblox allows. Switch between a quick, simplified view or dive into advanced mode for pixel-perfect results.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
This plugin was made source-available due to Roblox Creator Store requirements (which block the use of `InsertService`).

1. Download the [**latest release**](https://github.com/Vexot/CustomEmoteThumbnail/releases) from this repository.
2. Place the file in your **Roblox Studio Local Plugins** folder.

## ðŸ“š Notes
- Some functionality comes from **Roblox Client Tracker** due to the lack of official documentation on emote thumbnail customization.  
- This code wasnâ€™t originally meant to be released (it was rushed out before I traveled), so donâ€™t expect perfectly polished codeâ€¦ yet!
